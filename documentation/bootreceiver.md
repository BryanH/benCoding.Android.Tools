benCoding.Android.Tools

A collection of utilities designed to make working with Titanium on Android alittle easier.

<h2>Features</h2>

* On BOOT_COMPLETED create a notification with information defined in your project's tiapp.xml
* Use Titanium Properties to configure a BOOT_COMPLETED action you wish to be taken.

<h2>Module Setup</h2>

* Download the latest release from the releases folder ( or you can build it yourself )
* Install the bencoding.sms module. If you need help here is a "How To" [guide](https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/Configuring+Apps+to+Use+Modules). 
* You can now use the module via the commonJS require method, example shown below.
